Sometimes I have ideas about new tools to build but I don't have the needed

time to implement them. To be sure that *my idea is reserved* I created this

tiny tool which reserves the name of the package on NPM. :bulb:


## :cloud: Installation

You can install the package globally and use it as command line tool:


```sh
# Using npm
npm install --global npmreserve

# Using yarn
yarn global add npmreserve
```


Then, run `npmreserve --help` and see what the CLI tool can do.


```
$ npmreserve --help
Usage: npmreserve [options]

Options:
  -n, --name <name>          The NPM package name.
  -d, --desc <description>   The NPM package description.
  -o, --other-fields <json>  Other package.json fields you want to include. The
                             input will be parsed as JSON.
  -h, --help                 Displays this help.
  -v, --version              Displays version information.

Examples:
  npmreserve -n 'foo'
  npmreserve -n 'bar' -o "{\"author\": \"`whoami`\"}"

Use this with care. Do not abuse the things too much. Do not spam.

```

## :clipboard: Example


Here is an example how to use this package as library. To install it locally, as library, you can do that using `npm` (or `yarn`):

```sh
# Using npm
npm install --save npmreserve

# Using yarn
yarn add npmreserve
```



```js
// Dependencies
var NpmReserve = require("npmreserve");

console.log("Reserving...");
NpmReserve("aaaaa", function (err) {
    console.log(err || "Reserved.");
});
```

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:


 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
